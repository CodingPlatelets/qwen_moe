      "|---------|---------|----------|\n",
      "| **Gating** | *Top‑1* (hard‑top‑1) – each token routed to a single expert. This keeps compute per token minimal. | *Top‑2* (soft‑top‑2) – each token routed to two experts; the outputs are weighted (softmax). This increases expressiveness at the cost of a ~2× compute overhead. |\n",
      "| **Expert Sharing** | No sharing across layers; each layer has its own set of 8 experts. | Some experts may be shared across layers (“global experts”), which can help regularization and reduce memory. |\n",
      "| **Expert Size** | 8 experts * 7B/8 ≈ 0.875 B per expert. | Larger hidden dimension → each expert is ≈1.5 B parameters. |\n",
      "| **Layer Placement** | MoE layers inserted every 4 layers (≈ 8 MoE layers total). | MoE layers inserted more frequently (≈ 10–12 MoE layers total). |\n",
      "| **Activation Functions** | GELU + SwiGLU in feed‑forward. | GLU + SwiGLU, but with an extra gating bias (“expert gating bias”). |\n",

      "| **Cloud inference (pay‑as‑you‑go)** | Less expensive because compute per token is lower. | Still cheaper than dense 72B, but costlier than Mixtral. |\n",
      "| **Fine‑tuning on domain data** | Works well with 4‑GPU fine‑tuning; adapters are effective. | Fine‑tuning needs 8‑GPU nodes; consider LoRA or adapter layers. |\n",
      "| **Multi‑lingual support** | Good for English; additional languages need fine‑tuning. | Native multi‑lingual (especially Chinese) support. |\n",

      "## Bottom‑Line Takeaway\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Mixtral** is a *compact* MoE model that is highly efficient on English‑centric workloads. Its top‑1 gating keeps inference cost low, making it attractive for high‑throughput, low‑latency applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Qwen‑MOE** is a *larger* MoE model that shines in multi‑lingual, instruction‑following, and knowledge‑heavy scenarios, especially where Chinese language support is critical. The top‑2 gating gives it more expressive power at a modest cost increase.\n",

      "Choosing between them boils down to the trade‑off you’re willing to make:\n",
